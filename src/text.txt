&mut in the ios stdin is allowed to mutation 

.expect("failed to read line");

What is io::stdin()?
io stands for input/output, and it's a module in Rust's standard library (std).
stdin is a function in the io module that provides access to the standard input (keyboard input, in this case).


What is .read_line()?
The .read_line() method is used to read input from the user and store it into a string variable.

It takes a mutable reference to a String (&mut guess) where it will store the input.
When you type something and press Enter, .read_line() captures everything you typed (including the newline character \n) and appends it to the String.



so the rust takes the \n value too if we ddint take the trim 
.trim()


match is like switch ;
